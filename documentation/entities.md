### Delete all orphaned entities

Mass clean up your Home Assistant by deleting all orphaned entities in one go.

Orphaned entities are entities that are no longer claimed by an integration. This can happen when an integration is removed or when an integration is no longer working. Home Assistant considers an entity only orphaned if it has been unclaimed since the last restart of Home Assistant.

:::{warning}
Entities might have been marked orphaned because an integration is offline or not working since Home Assistant started. Calling this service will delete those entities as well.
