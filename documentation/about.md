Hi! I'm Spook 👻 and I'm a {term}`custom integration <integration>` for use with {term}`Home Assistant`. I will extend your Home Assistant instance with a huge set of scary powerful tools. 🛠️

:::{warning} Just to be clear from the very start...
**Spook is not supported by the Home Assistant project.**

This custom integration is provided as-is, without any warranty.

# Cool, but what does it do?

So, there are a lot of things/features that will never end up in Home Assistant itself.

This can have various reasons. For example, it is just too random, out of scope, not matching the Home Assistant philosophy, violates architectural design, is still in early development, experimental, explorative, or just freaking useless.

Spook doesn't care. He is your homie!

So, maybe, that one feature you wanted Home Assistant to have, is in the toolbox provided by Spook.

All that said, Spook is a scary powerful toolbox for Home Assistant, but
don't be scared, he is a friendly ghost, he is your homie 👻

# What do I get from Spook?

Spook will add new features to Home Assistant and extend existing ones.

For example, Spook will add new features to existing {term}`actions <action>` that you can use in your {term}`automations <automation>` and scripts. It will also add lots of new ones.

Spook will also add new {term}`entities <entity>` to existing integration you use in your Home Assistant instance to provide more data points to monitor and control. For example, it will add entities to control and monitor your {term}`Home Assistant Cloud` connection.

Finally, Spook will constantly float around in your Home Assistant, and if it finds potential issues along the way, it will report them to you. For example, if you are using a non-existing entity in your automations, Spook will let you know by raising an issue on your {term}`repairs dashboard <repairs>`.

Spook 👻 will extend your Home Assistant instance with a huge set of scary powerful tools. 🛠️
