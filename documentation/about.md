Hi! I'm Spook 👻 and I'm a {term}`custom integration <integration>` for use with {term}`Home Assistant`. I will extend your Home Assistant instance with a huge set of scary powerfull tools. 🛠️

:::{warning} Just to be clear from the very start...
**Spook is not supported by the Home Assistant project.**

This custom integration is provided as-is, without any warranty or support, and above all has a very [restrictive license](license).

If you experience issues with this integration, or as a result of this integration, please go cry a lot on your own. You will not be provided with a tissue to dry up your tears when you are crying in a fetal position under your desk after ignoring this warning.

I've warned you.

# Cool, but what does it do?

So, there a lot of things/features, that will never end up in Home Assistant itself.

This can have various reasons, for example: It is just too random, out of scope, not matching the Home Assistant philosophy, violating architectural design, still in early development, experimental, explorative, or just freaking useless.

Spook doesn't care. He is nobodies homie.

So, maybe, that one feature you wanted Home Assistant to have, is in the toolbox provided by Spook. All stuff in here, is not part of Home Assistant (or at least not yet) for a reason. So, don't expect it to work, or to be supported, or well, for starters, to be a good idea.

All that said, Spook is a scary powerfull toolbox for Home Assistant, but be aware, Spook is not your homie!

# What do I get from Spook?

Spook will add new features to Home Assistant and extend existing ones of it.

For example, Spook will add new features to existing {term}`services <service>` that you can use in your {term}`automations <automation>` and scripts. It will also add lots of new ones.

Spook will also add new {term}`entities <entity>` to existing integration you use in your Home Assistant instance to provide more datapoints to monitor and control. For example, it will add entities to control and monitor your {term}`Home Assistant Cloud` connection.

Finally, Spook will constantly float around in your Home Assistant, and if it finds potential issues along the way, it will report them to you. For example, if you are using an non-existing entity in your automations, Spook will let you know by raising a issue on your {term}`repairs dashboard <repairs>`.

Spook 👻 will extend your Home Assistant instance with a huge set of scary powerfull tools. 🛠️

# Sounds scary, I'm out!

Understood. Using the least amount of custom integrations is always the best way to go. So, if you are not comfortable with this, don't use Spook.

Don't worry, it won't bite and it will not deliberatly break your Home Assistant system. It is just not supported, and it is not part of Home Assistant. So, if you want to use it, you are on your own.

# I like to learn more first

Even better, maybe check out the [](background_and_history) page to learn more about the background and history of Spook. The [](faq) page might also be a good place to start.

# I'm in! How do I install it?

Follow the instructions on dedicated page for that: [](installation).
