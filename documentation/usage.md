Now you have Spook [installed](installation); you can start using it. It is hard to explain what Spook does, but its experience in using it is best described as: _oddly familiar_ ðŸ™‚.

As Spook extends existing {term}`Home Assistant` functionality, everything you already know about Home Assistant applies. You might run into an issue raised in the {term}`repairs dashboard <repairs>` by Spook, have more {term}`devices <device>` and {term}`entities <entity>` to play with, some {term}`actions <action>` have more options available, and new actions will appear when you create new {term}`automations <automation>`.

## Repairs

Spook will constantly float around in your Home Assistant instance, and if it finds potential issues along the way, it will report them to you by creating an issue in the Home Assistant {term}`repairs dashboard <repairs>`.

```{figure} images/usage/repairs_example.png
:name: Spook raised a repair issue

This automation uses some entities that do not exist.
```

Spook will always provide you with information on how to fix the issue and, if possible, even provide you with a button to fix it for you.

Maybe Spook has already found something? You can use the {term}`My Home Assistant` button below to open your Home Assistant instance and show your repairs dashboard.

## Actions

{term}`Actions <actions>` are a common way to control Home Assistant. Most of the {term}`actions <action>` you'll use in an automations. Spook will add new features to existing actions that you can use in your {term}`automations <automation>` and {term}`scripts <script>`. It will also add lots of new ones.

Spook reveals himself on each of the action he added or enriched, so you can easily find and identify them in your Home Assistant instance.

:name: Spook provides lots of new and powerful actions.
