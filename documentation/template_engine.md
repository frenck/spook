{term}`Home Assistant` has a powerful {term}`template engine <template engine>` that allows you to create complex automations and logic. The template engine is based on the [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) template engine which is enriched with some Home Assistant-specific extensions.

{term}`Templates <template>` can be used in many places in Home Assistant, such as in {term}`automations <automation>`, {term}`scripts <script>`, and {term}`scenes <scene>`, and can even be used to create custom {term}`entities <entity>`.

Spook extends the template engine of Home Assistant Core with even more functionality, making it even more powerful. Most of these make it easier to perform common tasks, while others provide completely new functionality.
