Some other miscellaneous core features that didn't fit elsewhere in the documentation.

Maybe I'm just bad at structuring the documentation? If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## Services

The following miscellaneous services are added to your Home Assistant instance:

### Restart

Restarts Home Assistant. Spook extends the existing restart service with an "force" option to force Home Assistant to restart immediately, ignoring all safety guards.

:::{note}
Restarting Home Assistant will interrupt all running automations, scripts, and
integrations. It is recommended to use this service only when necessary.

:::{warning}
When enabling `force`, by setting it to `true`, Home Assistant will restart immediately, ignoring all safety guards. This means it will ignore **everything**. It will not check your configuration, and it will even interrupt database migrations and just kill Home Assistant to restart it as fast as possible. This is not recommended and should only be used when absolutely necessary.
