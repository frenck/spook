A zone in {term}`Home Assistant` is a virtual representation of a physical space. Think of it as drawing a circle on a map; that circle represents a zone. Zones are used to track the location of people and devices but can also be used to trigger {term}`automations <automation>` based on entering or leaving a zone.

Spook adds new services to the zone integrations that allow you to manage and modify them using automations dynamically.
