The group {term}`helper <helper>` integration lets you combine multiple {term}`entities <entity>` into a single entity. Entities that are members of a group can be controlled and monitored as a whole.

This can be useful for cases where you want to control, for example, the multiple bulbs in a light fixture as a single light in {term}`Home Assistant`, or maybe you want to combine all the wall plugs that control all your Christmas decorations into a single switch entity.

## Devices & entities

Spook does not provide any new devices or entities for this integration.

## Services

Spook does not provide service enhancements for this integration.

## Repairs

While Spook is floating around in your Home Assistant instance, it will raise repairs issues if it has found something that is not right.

### Unknown source entity

Spook inspects all groups created to find group member entities that no longer exist. If Spook finds such a case, it will raise a repair issue, informing you about the problematic group and the member entity that is missing.

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the missing entity from the group or fix the referenced source entity. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.
