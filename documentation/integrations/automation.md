Automations are the heart of {term}`Home Assistant`. It is what makes Home Assistant a home automation platform. It is the glue that binds all the other {term}`integrations <integration>` together, and it is what makes your home smart and comfortable.

Non-working automations, however, are a source of frustration. And sometimes, it can take you a bit to notice there is an issue with an automation. Spook enhances the automation integration of Home Assistant by raising repairs issues in case it detects something is wrong with an automation.

## Devices & entities

Spook does not provide any new devices or entities for this integration.

## Services

Spook does not provide service enhancements for this integration.

## Repairs

While Spook is floating around in your Home Assistant instance, it will raise repairs issues if it has found something that is not right.

### Unknown referenced areas

Automations are inspected for the use of areas. If an automation is targeting an area in one of its service calls that do not exist, Spook will raise a repair issue. The repairs issue raised will contain the name of the automation and the area that is referenced but not found.

```{figure} ../images/integrations/automation/unknown_areas.png

:alt: Screenshot showing a repair raised by Spook for an automation.
:align: center

```

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the reference to the non-existing area or fix the referenced area. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.

{term}`Templates <template>` in automations are not evaluated by Spook. That means that service calls that target areas dynamically using a template, are not considered by Spook.

### Unknown referenced devices

Automations are inspected for the use of devices. If an automation is using a device that does not exist, Spook will raise a repair issue. The repairs issue raised will contain the name of the automation and the device that is referenced but not found.

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the reference to the non-existing device or fix the referenced device. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.

{term}`Templates <template>` in automations are not evaluated by Spook. That means that devices used in templates, are not considered by Spook.
:::

### Unknown referenced entities

Automations are inspected for the use of {term}`entities <entity>`. If an automation is using an {term}`entity ID <entity id>` that does not exist, Spook will raise a repair issue. The repairs issue raised will contain the name of the automation and the entity ID that is referenced but not found.

```{figure} ../images/integrations/automation/example.png
:name: Spook found an issue with an automation that is using a non-existing entity.
:alt: Screenshot showing a repair raised by Spook for an automation.
:align: center

Spook found an issue with an automation that is using non-existing entities.
```

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the reference to the non-existing entity ID or fix the referenced entity ID. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.

- {term}`Templates <template>` in automations are not evaluated by Spook. That means that entity IDs used in templates, or targets generated using templates, are not considered by Spook.
- Comma separated lists of entity IDs are not taken into consideration by Spook. It is advisable to convert these to an actual list in your automations.
