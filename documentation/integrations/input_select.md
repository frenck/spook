The input select {term}`helper` in {term}`Home Assistant` allows the user to define a list of options that can be controlled via the frontend and can be used within conditions of an {term}`automation <automation>`. The frontend can display a dropdown or a list of buttons. Changes to the dropdown or list of buttons generate state events. These state events can be utilized as automation triggers as well.

Spook adds some new actions to the input select {term}`integration <integration>`, which allows one to select a random option and to shuffle or sort the list of options in the input select.

## Repairs

Spook has no repair detections for this integration.

## Uses cases

Some use cases for the enhancements Spook provides for this integration:

- The shuffle and random abilities can have very fun use cases in automations. For example, select a random person to cook dinner or do chores, or shuffle a sequence of scenes to play.
- The input select entity doesn't allow you to re-order the options. The sort ability allows you to sort the options alphabetically, at least.
