The trend {term}`helper <helper>` integration show the trend of a numeric value over time. It does so by tracking the state of a source entity, such as a sensor, and calculating the trend based on the difference between the current and previous state.

## Devices & entities

Spook does not provide any new devices or entities for this integration.

## Services

Spook does not provide service enhancements for this integration.

## Repairs

While Spook is floating around in your Home Assistant instance, it will raise repairs issues if it has found something that is not right.

### Unknown source entity

Spook inspects all trend sensors created to find source entities they meter that no longer exist. If Spook finds such a case, it will raise a repair issue, informing you about the problematic trend helper and the source entity that is missing.

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the trend helper or restore the referenced source entity. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.
