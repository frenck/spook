A {term}`blueprint <blueprint>` in {term}`Home Assistant` is a reusable {term}`automation <automation>` or {term}`script <script>`, most often shared and created by the community, that can be imported into your Home Assistant instance.

They are a great way to learn how to automate your home and an inspiration for new automation ideas, or just an easy way to get started. Blueprints are a great method to share your automation creations with others, so that others can apply them to their own homes.
