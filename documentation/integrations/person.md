The person {term}`integration <integration>` in {term}`Home Assistant` allows you to track the location of people in your household. It is a collection of device trackers that are grouped together to represent the current location of a person. Additionally, a person may have a user account attached to it, which allows the person to log in to the Home Assistant.

Spook adds some new services to the person {term}`integration <integration>`, that allows you to dynamically change the device trackers attached to a person in Home Assistant.
