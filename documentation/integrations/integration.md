<br><br>

The Riemann sum integral {term}`helper <helper>` calculates the <wiki:Riemann_sum> of the values provided by a source sensor. The Riemann sum is an approximation of an **[integral](wiki:Integral)** by a [finite sum](wiki:Summation).

This is most often used to calculate the total energy usage of a power meter by using the power meterâ€™s power consumption and the time between the measurements.

## Devices & entities

Spook does not provide any new devices or entities for this integration.

## Services

Spook does not provide service enhancements for this integration.

## Repairs

While Spook is floating around in your Home Assistant instance, it will raise repair issues if it has found something that is not right.

### Unknown source entity

Spook inspects all Riemann sum integral created {term}`entities <entity>`, and looks for cases where a source sensor entity is no longer present. If Spook finds such a case, it will raise a {term}`repair issue <repairs>`, informing you about the problematic entity.

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the helper or fix the referenced source {term}`entity ID <entity id>`. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.
