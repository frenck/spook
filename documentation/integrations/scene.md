<br><br>

A scene in {term}`Home Assistant` is a collection of {term}`entities <entity>` and their states. Scenes are used to set a predefined state for a group of entities. For example, a scene can be used to set the lights in your living room to a specific color and brightness or to set your media player's volume to a specific level and all restored to that stored state when the scene is activated.

Spook enhances the scene integration of Home Assistant by raising {term}`repairs <repairs>` issues in case it detects something is wrong with a scene.

## Devices & entities

Spook does not provide any new devices or entities for this integration.

## Services

Spook does not provide service enhancements for this integration.

## Repairs

While Spook is floating around in your Home Assistant instance, it will raise repairs issues if it has found something that is not right.

### Unknown referenced entities

Scenes are inspected for the use of {term}`entities <entity>`. If a scene uses an {term}`entity ID <entity id>` that does not exist, Spook will raise a repair issue. The repairs issue raised will contain the name of the scene and the entity ID that is referenced but not found.

:name: unknown entity

Spook found an issue with a scene that is using non-existing entities.
```

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the reference to the non-existing entity ID or fix the referenced entity ID. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.
