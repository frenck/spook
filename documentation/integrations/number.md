The number {term}`integration <integration>` provides numeric inputs to control {term}`devices & services <device>`. It differs from the [input number](input_number) helper in that the user does not directly create it but rather by other integrations.

Spook adds some new services to the number {term}`integration <integration>`, which allows you to set the value to the minimum or maximum value, and adds services to increase and decrease services the number value by a given amount.

Spook adds a bunch of new services to the number helper integrations.
```

## Devices & entities

Spook does not provide any new devices or entities for this integration.

## Services

Spook adds the following new service to your Home Assistant instance:

### Decrease value

Decrease a number entity value by a certain amount.

```

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
* - Service properties
* - {term}`Service`
  - Number: Decrease value ðŸ‘»
* - {term}`Service name`
  - `number.decrement`

  - Yes, `number` entities
* - {term}`Service response`
  - No response

```

If the `amount` attribute is not provided, the service will use the step value of the number entity. The `amount` attribute must be a multiple of the step value.

## Repairs

Spook has no repair detections for this integration.

## Uses cases

Some use cases for the enhancements Spook provides for this integration:

- Quickly, with a single service call, set the value of a number entity to its maximum or minimum value.
- Add the ability to increase or decrease the value of a number entity with a single service call instead of having to call the `number.set_value` service using a template that does calculations on the current state.

## Blueprints & tutorials

There are currently no known {term}`blueprints <blueprint>` or tutorials for the enhancements Spook provides for this integration. If you created one or stumbled upon one, [please let us know in our discussion forums](https://github.com/frenck/spook/discussions).

## Features requests, ideas, and support

If you have an idea on how to further enhance this integration, for example, by adding a new service, entity, or repairs detection; feel free to [let us know in our discussion forums](https://github.com/frenck/spook/discussions).
