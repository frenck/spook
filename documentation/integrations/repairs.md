<br><br>

The {term}`repairs <repairs>` {term}`integration <integration>` brings the repairs dashboards into {term}`Home Assistant`, which informs you about issues found in your Home Assistant instance. Other integrations (like Spook ðŸ‘» itself) provide these raised repair issues, so you can keep your system healthy and in a working state.

The issues raised always apply to your situation and system, so you can be sure the issues raised are relevant to you.

Spook enhances the integration by providing services that allow you to raise and manage your own repair issues.

Spook adds many new services to the repairs integration so that you can create your own.
```

## Devices & entities

Spook does not provide any new devices or entities for this integration.

### Buttons

#### Ignore all

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `button.ignore_all_issues`_

Adds a button to ignore all issues currently raised in the repairs dashboard.

:::{tip}
This might sometimes seem helpful; however, ignoring an issue is not a solution. It is better to fix the issue, remove the integration that is causing it, or report a bug.

Every issue raised by Home Assistant (and also Spook) should be solvable. If not, it is a bug and should be reported.
:::

#### Unignore all

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `button.unignore_all_issues`_

Adds a button to unignore all repair issues currently still active (but previously ignored).

### Events

#### Repair

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `event.repair`_

This event entity triggers when a new repair issue is raised, or an existing one is updated or removed.

### Sensors

#### Active issues

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `sensor.active_issues`_

This sensor shows the number of active issues currently raised in the repairs dashboard.

#### Ignored issues

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `sensor.ignored_issues`_

This sensor shows the number of ignored issues currently raised in the repairs dashboard.

#### Total issues

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `sensor.issues`_

This sensor shows the total number of issues known to the repairs dashboard.

## Services

Spook adds the following new service to your Home Assistant instance:

### Create issue

Create and raise your own issues in the repairs dashboard. For example,
to raise low battery reports for your devices or to raise an issue when
a device becomes unreachable.

```

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 2
* - Service call data
* - Attribute
  - Type
  - Required
  - Default / Example
* - `title`
  - {term}`string <string>`
  - Yes
* - `description`
  - {term}`string <string>`
  - Yes
* - `issue_id`
  - {term}`string <string>`
  - No
  - Randomly generated

  - No
  - `warning` (default), `error`, or `critical`
* - `persistent`
  - {term}`boolean <boolean>`
  - No

```

Setting an `issue_id` can be helpful, as you can use it to update the issue later on. If you create an issue with the same issue ID again, it will update the issue with the new data. The issue ID can also be used to remove the issue with the `repairs.remove` service.

The `domain` can be set to any integration domain. For example, if you set it to `automation`, the issue will show up as a repair issue for the automation integration. It defaults to the `spook` integration when not provided.

The `persistent` attribute can be set to `true` to indicate it should survive a Home Assistant restart. It defaults to `false` when not provided.

## Repairs

Spook has no repair detections for this integration.

## Uses cases

Some use cases for the enhancements Spook provides for this integration:

- Creating and raising your own issues has lots of possibilities. For example, you could create an issue when a device is low on battery or when a device is offline for a long time. You could also create an issue when a device is not responding to commands or when a device is not responding to commands in a certain time frame. The possibilities are endless.
