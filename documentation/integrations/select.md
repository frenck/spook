The select {term}`integration <integration>` provides a way to select a value from a list of options. It differs from the [input select](input_select) helper, in that it is not directly created by the user, but rather by other integrations.

Spook extends the select integration with an option to select a random option from the options offered by the select {term}`entity <entity>`.
