A script in {term}`Home Assistant` is a sequence of actions that are executed when the script is started or called via start using a {term}`service call <service call>`. Scripts are similar to {term}`automations <automation>`, but are not automatically executed when a trigger fires. Scripts are a great way to group a sequence of actions together that can be executed on demand and reused in multiple automations.

Non-working scripts, however, are (just like automations) a source of frustration. And sometimes, it can take you a bit to notice there is an issue with a script. Spook enhances the script integration of Home Assistant by raising repair issues in case it detects something is wrong with a script.

## Devices & entities

Spook does not provide any new devices or entities for this integration.

## Services

Spook does not provide service enhancements for this integration.

## Repairs

While Spook is floating around in your Home Assistant instance, it will raise repairs issues if it has found something that is not right.

### Unknown referenced areas

Scripts are inspected for the use of areas. If a script is targeting an area in one of its service calls that does not exist, Spook will raise a repair issue. The repairs issue raised will contain the name of the script and the area that is referenced but not found.

```{figure} ../images/integrations/script/unknown_area.png
:name: Spook found an issue with a script that is using a non-existing area.
:alt: Screenshot showing a repair raised by Spook for a script.
:align: center

```

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the reference to the non-existing area or fix the referenced area. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.

{term}`Templates <template>` in scripts are not evaluated by Spook. That means that service calls that target areas dynamically using a template, are not considered by Spook.

### Unknown referenced devices

Scripts are inspected for the use of devices. If a script is using a device that does not exist, Spook will raise a repair issue. The repairs issue raised will contain the name of the script and the device that is referenced but not found.

```

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the reference to the non-existing device or fix the referenced device. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.

{term}`Templates <template>` in script are not evaluated by Spook. That means that devices used in templates, are not considered by Spook.
:::

### Unknown referenced entities

Scripts are inspected for the use of {term}`entities <entity>`. If a script uses an {term}`entity ID <entity id>` that does not exist, Spook will raise a repair issue. The repairs issue raised will contain the name of the script and the entity ID that is referenced but not found.

```{figure} ../images/integrations/script/example.png
:name: Spook found an issue with a script that is using a non-existing entity.
:alt: Screenshot showing a repair raised by Spook for a script.
:align: center

Spook found an issue with a script that is using non-existing entities.
```

To resolve the raised issue, you can either remove the reference to the non-existing entity ID or fix the referenced entity ID. Spook will automatically remove the repair issue once the issue is fixed.

- {term}`Templates <template>` in script are not evaluated by Spook. That means that entity IDs used in templates, or targets generated using templates, are not considered by Spook.
- Comma separated lists of entity IDs are not taken into consideration by Spook. It is advisable to convert these to an actual list in your scripts.
