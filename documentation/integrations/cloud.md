The Home Assistant Cloud allows you to effortlessly use your {term}`Home Assistant` with various cloud services like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, but also provides remote access to your Home Assistant instance without having to deal with dynamic DNS, SSL certificates, and opening ports on your router.

Spook enhances the Home Assistant Cloud integration by creating a device for it and adding a series of {term}`entities <entity>` that can be used in your dashboards, automations, and scripts.

## Devices & entities

Spook adds a single new device with entities for this integration to your Home Assistant instance.

### Switches

#### Alexa

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `switch.cloud_alexa`_

This allows you to fully enable/disable integrating your instance with Amazon Alexa.

#### Alexa state reporting

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `switch.cloud_alexa_report_state`_

Allows you to control the state reporting to Alexa from an entity. If you enable state reporting, Home Assistant will send all state changes of exposed entities to Amazon. This allows you to always see the latest states in the Alexa app and use the state changes to create routines.
