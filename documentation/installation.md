Time to get Spook ðŸ‘» settled and installed in your Home Assistant instance.

Getting Spook up and running should not be too hard when you follow this guide. If you run into issues during the installation, please check the[support](support) page on where to go for help.

## Requirements

Spook needs a few things to work properly, so let's go over them first.

1. Read, understand, and accept [the license](license) of Spook.
2. A working {term}`Home Assistant` instance running version **2023.7.0 or newer.**

   :::{note}
   The minimal required version of Home Assistant will change over time. This is not something to worry about. It is only important that you run at least the minimal required version of Home Assistant on the first installation of Spook.
   :::

3. You have the {term}`Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) <HACS>` installed.

   :::{hint} I don't have HACS installed, how do I do that? ðŸ‘ˆ
   :class: dropdown

   Installing HACS is easy, just follow the [official installation guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/installation/manual).

   Or, if you are feeling lucky, run this script in an Home Assistant terminal to install HACS:

   ```shell
   wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -
   ```

If you have met these requirements, you are ready to install Spook. ðŸŽ‰
