{term}`Integrations <integration>` in {term}`Home Assistant` are the glue between your Home Assistant instance and the devices, services, and platforms you want to integrate with it. Spook enhances the core of Home Assistant by adding {term}`services <service>` to control those integrations.

## Services

The following integration management services are added to your Home Assistant instance:

### Disable an integration

Disable a single instance of an integration by its {term}`config entry <config entry>`.

Not sure what the `config_entry_id` of your integration is?

Use this service in the {term}`developer tools <developer tools>`, in the UI select the device you want to use and select the **Go to YAML mode** button. This will show you the config entry ID in the YAML code.

### Disable polling for updates

Disable integration polling of a single integration instance by its {term}`config entry <config entry>`.

Some integrations frequently poll for updates. In some cases, it can be helpful to disable this temporarily. For example, in case you are not at home and want to stop polling on an integration that consumes a paid API.

Some integrations frequently poll for updates. In some cases, it can be helpful to enable this just temporarily. For example, in case you are not at home and want to stop polling on an integration that consumes a paid API and want to turn it back on again when you are back.

### Ignore all discovered devices & services

When Home Assistant discovers new devices or services, it will show up on the integration dashboard. You can ignore them one by one, but this service will allow you to ignore all of them at once.

It also supports ignoring all discovered devices from a specific {term}`integration <integration>`. For example, if you want to ignore all discovered devices from the `bluetooth` integration, you could do that periodically with an automation.
