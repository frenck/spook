There are many ways you can contribute to the development of Spook.

## Reporting issue and submitting feature requests

Please report the bug on the [Spook issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/frenck/spook/issues). You can also submit a pull request with a fix. That would be even more awesome! ðŸ¤©

If you have a feature request, please share your idea on the [Spook discussion forum on GitHub](https://github.com/frenck/spook/discussions), or build it yourself and submit a feature request! ðŸ¤©

## Translating Spook

Spook is available in multiple languages. You can help translating Spook into your language!

Currently, Spook is using manual translations, you can find them here:

<https://github.com/frenck/spook/tree/main/custom_components/spook/translations>

The translations files are in a relatively simple JSON format. The English version is the `en.json` file, and is the source of thruth for all other languages. To update a translation, simply edit the file and submit a pull request. To add a new language, copy the `en.json` file to a new file with the language code as the filename (e.g., `nl.json` for Dutch) and start translating.

Missing translations in a language will automatically fallback to English version.

## Improving the documentation

Spook is already scary enough for many, so the documentation should be as good as possible.

The documentation is written in [MyST](https://mystmd.org/guide), which is just [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) but with some added functionality.

The source code of the documentation can be found in the `documentation` folder of our GitHub Repository:

<https://github.com/frenck/spook/tree/main/documentation>

To run the documentation locally, you'll need clone the Spook repository locally, and from the `documentation` folder, run:

```bash
npx myst start
```

This will start a local webserver on `http://localhost:3000` and will automatically update when you make changes to the documentation.

## Developing Spook

There isn't much fundamental structure for developing Spook. Hopefully this can be improved in the future.

You can find the source code of Spook on GitHub: <https://github.com/frenck/spook>

Some hints to get you going at least:

- As Spook is a custom integration, it can be developed in a regular Home Assistant development environment, as described [here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_environment). Just place the `spook` folder from the `custom_components` folder in the `custom_components` folder of your development environment config folder.
- If you develop Home Assistant in a virtual environment, you could clone Spook's repository in any folder and next symlink the `spook` folder from the `custom_components` folder in the `custom_components` folder of your development environment config folder.

Any help improving the development situation for Spook is welcome! For example, a nice and easy to use dev container would be amazing, or a good structure for unit tests.

### Opening a pull request

If you want to open a pull request, go ahead! ðŸ¤©

Please be sure, to test your changes before you open the PR to ensure the changes work as expected. Motivate / describe the change you are providing in the PR, so we don't have to figure that out from code change.

Also, please make sure to update the documentation if needed. I know this isn't the most fun part, but it is important for users to understand how to use the awesome changes you've made.
