{term}`Areas <area>` in {term}`Home Assistant` is a logical grouping of {term}`devices <device>` and {term}`entities <entity>` that are meant to match the areas (or rooms) in the physical world: your home.

Spook provides {term}`services <service>` that allows you to manage and {term}`automate <automation>` the areas in Home Assisatant programatically. Great for creating "dynamic" areas, or for creating areas on the fly.

```

## Services

Spook adds the following new service to your Home Assistant instance:

### Create an area

Adds a new area to your Home Assistant instance.

  - `Living room`
* - `aliases`
  - {term}`string <string>` | {term}`list of strings <list>`
  - No
  - `["Lounge", "Sitting area"]`
```

The use of `aliases` is helpful if you want to create an area with multiple names. For example, if you want to create an area called "Living room", but also want to be able to refer to it as "Sitting area" or "Lounge", you can add those names as aliases. This is used by Home Assistant Assist and Google Assistant.

:::{tip} Getting an area ID from an area name
:class: dropdown

Not sure what the `area_id` of an area is? The `area_id` field also accepts templates. You can use this template to use the area's name instead:

```yaml
area_id: "{{ area_id('Living room') }}"
```

That template will find the area ID of the area with the name "Living room".

### Add an alias to an area

Adds one or more aliases to an existing area. This service does not remove existing aliases, but adds the new ones to the existing ones.

As area aliases are used by voice assistants, you could add (and also remove) aliases to an area using {term}`automations <automation>`, which allows you to make them available/unavailable programatically.
