A {term}`device <device>` in {term}`Home Assistant` represents a physical device in your home but can also represent a web service, like one that provides weather information. Devices are logical grouping for entities. Spook provides you with a few actions to manage devices.

## Actions

The following device management actions are added to your Home Assistant instance:

### Disable a device

This action allows you to disable a device on the fly.

```

:::{tip} Finding a device ID
:class: dropdown

Not sure what the `device_id` of an your device is? There are a few ways to find it:

Use this action in the developer tools, in the UI select the device you want to add and select the **Go to YAML mode** button. This will show you the device ID in the YAML code.

Alternatively, you can visit the device page in the UI and look at the URL. The device ID is the last part of the URL, and will look something like this: `dc23e666e6100f184e642a0ac345d3eb`.

```{code-block} yaml
:linenos:
action: homeassistant.disable_device
data:
  device_id: "dc23e666e6100f184e642a0ac345d3eb"
```

Or multiple devices at once:

```{code-block} yaml
:linenos:
action: homeassistant.disable_device
data:
  device_id:
    - "dc23e666e6100f184e642a0ac345d3eb"
