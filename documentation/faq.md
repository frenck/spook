Some of the same questions keep popping up. So, here are some answers to the most common questions about Spook 👻.

```{card}
:header: **Is this a serious thing?**

**Yes!** It absolutely is.

It is just not a normal {term}`integration`, like one that connects to a {term}`device` or {term}`service`, or one that provides a {term}`helper <helper>` of some sort. But it is a serious integration that is meant to be used in a serious way.
```

```{card}
:header: **Does this integration break my Home Assistant instance??**

Well, that is not the goal of course. But it is a {term}`custom integration <integration>`, so there is a chance it might break your instance. This applies to any custom integration, not just Spook.

I'm just sharing what I have [without any warranty](license).

```{card}
:header: **Does Spook do random things to my home?**

No. It does not do random things. It is not a [chaos testing](wiki:Chaos_engineering) thing, and it will not turn lights on/off randomly in the night. Unless it is a bug or broken of course.
```

```{card}
:header: **Ok, so should I use Spook?**

No! [The license](license) doesn't allow that.
```

```{card}
:header: **I want to suggest a new feature for Spook**

Oh! Lovely, please [share your idea on our discussion forums](https://github.com/frenck/spook/discussions)! Maybe it is something that can be added to Spook 👻 in the future.
```

```{card}
:header: **Why is Spook called Spook?**

"Spook" is the [Dutch](wiki:The_Netherlands) term for "ghost", as was inspired
by <wiki:Casper_the_Friendly_Ghost>. Check out the [](background_and_history) for a more detailed version of the story.
```

```{card}
:header: **What is going on with the version numbers of Spook?**

Releases use a [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), compatible version number format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, as that is required for {term}`Home Assistant`. But... only the format is used.

Spook is a rebel, and will not follow the rules of Semantic Versioning, instead, it uses the following rules:

- `MAJOR`: If there is almost nothing changed, or a lot has changed.
- `MINOR`: No idea, possibly breaking, or not.
- `PATCH`: Didn't care enough to change more numbers.

So, Spook version numbers have no meaning at all. It is just a number. The only guarantee is that a higher version number is newer than a lower one.
```

```{card}
:header: **I'm waiting for the next release because of \<insert any reason\>. Got an ETA?**

Sorry, no ETA. This is a pet project on which I work in my spare time. I will release a new version when I feel like it.
```
