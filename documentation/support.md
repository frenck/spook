## I'm sure I've found a bug!

Great! 🎉 Well, not really, but at least it means we can look into fixing it, so others won't experience the same issue.

Please report the bug on the [Spook issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/frenck/spook/issues).

If you are a [developer](development), you can also submit a pull request with a fix. That would be even more awesome! 🤩

## I have so many more questions about Spook 😵‍💫

Well, there is a lot more documentation on Spook to explore. You can find it all in the sidebar on the left.

If you like to learn more about Spook, the [](background_and_history) and the [](faq) pages might be good starting points to find answers to your questions. Otherwise, the resources mentioned at the top of this page are good places to get your questions answered.

## The documentation sucks! 😭

Documentation always does, but thanks for complimenting my hard work 😂. It is a never-ending story. However, you can help! 🤩
