{term}`Floors <floor>` in {term}`Home Assistant` is a logical grouping of {term}`areas <area>` that are meant to match floors (or levels) in the physical world: your home. Floors are used to group areas together that are on the same floor in your home. Floors give a better overview of your home and can be used to target {term}`actions <performing actions>` to a specific floor, like turning off all the lights on the first floor.

Spook provides that allows you to manage and {term}`automate <automation>` the floors in Home Assistant programatically. Great for creating "dynamic" floors, or for creating floors on the fly.

## Actions

Spook adds the following new actions to your Home Assistant instance:

### Create a floor

Adds a new floor to your Home Assistant instance.

```

```

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 2
* - Action data parameters

  - No
  - `1`
* - `aliases`
  - {term}`string <string>` | {term}`list of strings <list>`
  - No
  - `["ground floor", "downstairs"]`
```

The use of `aliases` is helpful if you want to create an floor with multiple names. For example, if you want to create an floor called "First floor", but also want to be able to refer to it as "Ground floor" or "Downstairs", you can add those names as aliases. This is used by Home Assistant Assist.

```{code-block} yaml
:linenos:
action: homeassistant.create_floor
data:
  name: "First floor"
  icon: "mdi:floor-1"
  level: 1
  aliases:
    - "Ground floor"
    - "Downstairs"
```

:::{tip} Getting an floor ID from a floor name
:class: dropdown

Not sure what the `floor_id` of a floor is? The `floor_id` field also accepts templates. You can use this template to use the floor's name instead:

```yaml
floor_id: "{{ floor_id('First floor') }}"
```

That template will find the floor ID of the floor with the name "First floor".

### Add an alias to a floor

Adds one or more aliases to an existing floor. This action does not remove existing aliases, but adds the new ones to the existing ones.

As floor aliases are used by voice assistants, you could add (and also remove) aliases to a floor using {term}`automations <automation>`, which allows you to make them available/unavailable programatically.
