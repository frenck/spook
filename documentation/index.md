_Spook is a scary powerful toolbox for Home Assistant, but don't be scared, Spook is your homie!_

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my (one and only) {term}`custom integration <integration>` for {term}`Home Assistant`: Spook! ðŸ‘»

Spook is my friend and my personal little pet project that I develop in my free spare time to add some features to Home Assistant that I (or others) think are missing; but are not a good fit to ship with Home Assistant itself.

If you would ever ask me, if you should use Spook? I would say: Absofuckinglutely! (But, I might be biased ðŸ˜‰) Spook has become an scary powerful toolbox for Home Assistant, that many have come to love.

Want to start using Spook? I would recommend picking up at the [getting started](about) section of the documentation. If you like to learn more about Spook its origin first, check out the [background and history](background_and_history) page for more information on that. Lastly, maybe the [](faq) page can help you.

Boo! ðŸ‘»
