_Spook is a scary powerfull toolbox for Home Assistant, but be aware, Spook is not your homie!_

:::{important}
The Spook documentation is currently in development.

**It is not complete and may contain errors**  
(but honestly, that will also be the case when it is complete).
:::

So, there a lot of things/features, that will never end up in Home Assistant itself.

This can have various reasons, for example: It is just too random, out of scope, not matching the Home Assistant philosophy, iolating architectural design, still in early development, experimental, explorative, or just freaking useless.

Spook doesn't care. He is nobodies homie.

So, maybe, that one feature you wanted Home Assistant to have, is in Spook.

However, remember, Spook is not your homie. All stuff in here, is not part of Home Assistant (or at least not yet) for a reason. So, don't expect it to work, or to be supported, or well, for starters, to be a good idea.
