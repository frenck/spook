Besides all new {term}`services <service>` for {term}`Home Assistant` itself, Spook will also add a bunch of {term}`devices <device>` and {term}`entities <entity>` that are all about Home Assistant. Basically, turning Home Assistant itself into its own integration, providing entities you can monitor and control.

## Devices & entities

Spook adds a single new device with entities for this integration to your Home Assistant instance.

### Buttons

#### Reload Home Assistant

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `button.homeassistant_reload`_

Reload all Home Assistant configuration with a single click of a button. This might be useful if you have a management dashboard of some kind.

#### Restart Home Assistant

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `button.homeassistant_restart`_

Restart Home Assistant with a single click of a button. This might be useful if you have a management dashboard of some kind.

### Sensors

#### Total number of entities

_Default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>`: `sensor.entities`_

The total number of entities in your system (including this one).

#### Total number of entities per entity type

For each entity type, a sensor is created that counts the number of entities of that type. The default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>` is listed after each sensor below.

- Number of `air_quality` entities (`sensor.air_quality`)
- Number of `alarm_control_panel` entities (`sensor.alarm_control_panels`)
- Number of `binary_sensor` entities (`sensor.binary_sensors`)
- Number of `button` entities (`sensor.buttons`)
- Number of `calendar` entities (`sensor.calendars`)
- Number of `camera` entities (`sensor.cameras`)
- Number of `climate` entities (`sensor.climate`)

#### Total number of helpers per type

For each helpers with their own domain, a sensor is created that counts the number of helpers. The default {term}`entity ID <Entity ID>` is listed after each sensor below.

- Number of `input_boolean` helpers (`sensor.input_booleans`)

- Number of `input_datetime` helpers (`sensor.input_datetimes`)

- Number of `input_text` helpers (`sensor.input_texts`)

#### Other counters

But wait, there are more counters! The following sensors are also added:

- Number of areas (`sensor.areas`)
- Number of automations (`sensor.automations`)
