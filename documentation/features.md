Spook ships with a lot of goodness for you to explore. Currently, there are three main areas of functionality that Spook sprinkles on top of {term}`Home Assistant`.

:::{card} Core extensions
:footer: ðŸ“š [Learn more](core_extensions)

The core extensions extends the functionality of Home Assistant's core itself. These are all extensions that are not tied to a specific {term}`integration <integration>`.

It provides new {term}`devices <device>` & {term}`entities <entity>` to provide information on the internals of Home Assistant. It adds a whole bunch of that allow you to control and manage integrations, devices, entities, and {term}`areas <area>`.

:::{card} Enhanced integrations
:footer: ðŸ“š [Learn more](enhanced_integrations)

Integrations are the "plugins" of Home Assistant; they come in all sorts of types. Most commonly are the ones that connect to a device or service, but there are more, like {term}`helpers <helper>` (input helpers, groups, etc) or ones that provide building blocks for other integrations (light, climate, switch, etc).

Spook enhances the following Home Assistant integrations by sprinkling some {term}`ectoplasmic <ectoplasm>` goodness on top of them. It may add new actions, entities, devices, or even replace and extend existing ones to provide more functionality.
:::

:::{card} Helpers
:footer: ðŸ“š [Learn more](helpers)

Spook also provides {term}`helpers <helper>`. The helpers allows you to perform calculations or modifications on existing {term}`entities <entity>` and return the result of that as a new entity.

If it doesn't fit in any of the above, you can find it here. ðŸ™ƒ  
Stuff in here is probably not really useful, but it's fun to play with.
