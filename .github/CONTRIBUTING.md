Are you considering doing that? For real?
This repository has quite an annoying license...

## Issues and feature requests

If you have found a bug... congratulations!
Feel free to fix it in your own time.

Got a feature request? Nice! Take a good size piece of paper, write
it down in just a couple of words. Fold it a couple of times so you
are left with a nice small folded feature request. Now shred it into
pieces. Done.

## Pull request process

You can try... maybe... who knows.

## What did I just read?

A question.
