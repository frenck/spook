# About <!-- omit from toc -->

Spook is a custom integration for Home Assistant, which is not your homie.

You should not use this custom integration, nor should you expect it to work.
The integration will break a lot, and will probably not survive the next
Home Assistant upgrade. Heck, it will most likely not even survive its own
next release.

This integration comes with absolutely 0/zero/zip/nada/noppes support,
and has less documentation than the quirks of my partner.

Above all, this integration may just break your setup in an way
that is not recoverable. Nor will it provide you with a tissue
to dry up your tears when you are crying in a fetal position
under your desk after ignoring all of the above.

I've warned you :D

# Previously part of Spook

Some of the amazing things Spook does, may turn out to be actually pretty good
and have eventually end up into Home Assistant natively, or, became obsolete
because of similar features they added.

So here is a list of things that have been removed from Spook ðŸ‘» _#loser_

## Obsolete integration & platform YAML configuration repairs

> Find YAML configuration for an integrations (and older integration platforms)
> that no longer support it.

As of Home Assistant 2023.5 (refined in 2023.6), Home Assistant will raise
repair issues for these cases itself.

# Frequently Asked Questions

In the first few days after putting Spook out, some of the same questions
kept popping up. So, here are some answers to those questions.

## Is this a serious thing?

Yes! It is just not a normal integration, like one that connects to a device or
service, or one that provides a helper of some sort. But it is a serious
integration, that is meant to be used in a serious way.

## Why is Spook called Spook?

I (Frenck) am Dutch. I grew up with "Casper het vriendelijke spookje", also
known as "Casper the friendly ghost". "Spook" is the Dutch for "ghost".

Casper is scary at first sight, but you could really love him in the end. Which
seems fitting for a custom integration, as custom integrations are more likely
to break, thus being a little scared of them is not a bad thing.

"Not your homie" is a refence to my the livestreams I used to do. I called my
viewers "My Home Assistant Homies", or just "Homies". It is thus referring
to you, the Home Assistant user, as my friend, my homie. However, "Spook" is
not your homie, it is a ghost, a spooky thing, he is suposed to make you think
a little about what you are doing before you use it.

Nice little fact, I did use "homey" at first (to maybe annoy the Homey users a
bit in SEO), but I decided not to be that _badword_ and to change it back to
just "homie".

Lastly, the little ghost logo & use of the emoji. This is great inspiration
from the Mushroom card project (I love it!). They use a simple mushroom emoji
and you see it everywhere in the Home Assistant community, thus decided to do
a similar thing.

## Does this integration break my Home Assistant instance?

Well, that is not the goal of course. But, it is a custom integration, so
there is a chance it might break your instance. This applies to any custom
integration, not just Spook.

I'm just sharing what I have, without any warranty. I've decided to be blunt
about it, and make it at least fun to read. I could have written a small
warning, that would have been boring.

## Does Spook do random things to my home?

No. It does not do random things. It is not a chaos testing thing and
it will not turn lights on/off randomly in the night. Unless it is a bug
or broken of course.

## Ok, so should I use Spook?

No! The license doesn't allow that (see below).

# Translating Spook

Spook isn't very good at speaking different languages, but you can help!

As a matter of fact, Spooks translation files are [CC0 licensed](./custom_components/spook/translations/LICENSE.md)!

Translating can be done from your webbrowser, no programming knowledge
is needed!

# Changelog & Releases

This repository does not keep a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on the direction the wind blows.

Releases use a [Semantic Versioning][semver], compatible version number of
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, as that is required for Home Assistant. In a nutshell,
the version will be incremented based on the following:

- `MAJOR`: If there is almost nothing changed.
- `MINOR`: I have no idea, possibily breaking.
- `PATCH`: I didn't care enough to change more numbers.
