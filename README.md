# About <!-- omit from toc -->

Spook is a custom integration for Home Assistant, which is not your homie.

You should not use this custom integration, nor should you expect it to work.
The integration will break a lot, and will probably not survive the next
Home Assistant upgrade. Heck, it will most likely not even survive its own
next release.

This integration comes with absolutely 0/zero/zip/nada/noppes support,
and has less documentation than the quirks of my partner.

Above all, this integration may just break your setup in an way
that is not recoverable. Nor will it provide you with a tissue
to dry up your tears when you are crying in a fetal position
under your desk after ignoring all of the above.

I've warned you :D

## Cool, but why? What is it? <!-- omit from toc -->

So, there a lot of things/features, that will never end up in Home Assistant itself.

This can have various reasons, for example: It is just too random, out of scope,
not matching the Home Assistant philosophy, violating architectural design,
still in early development, experimental, explorative, or just freaking useless.

Spook doesn't care. He is nobodies homie.

So, maybe, that one feature you wanted Home Assistant to have, is in Spook.

However, remember, Spook is not your homie. All stuff in here, is not part of
Home Assistant (or at least not yet) for a reason. So, don't expect it to work,
or to be supported, or well, for starters, to be a good idea.

# Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=frenck&repository=spook&category=integration)

You can find it in the HACS store by searching for "Spook", but you shoudn't.
You could manually add this repository to HACS, but you shouldn't. You can
also install it manually by copying the `spook` folder into your
`custom_components` folder, but you shouldn't.

Just don't.

# Configuration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=spook)

You shouldn't.

# Entities

This integration will provide you with entities you'd absolutely do not need.
All of them are enabled by default to ensure you have a bad time, straight
of the box.

## Sensors

- **Total number of entities**: To show your friends how big your setup is. _#compensation_
- **Number of entities for each entity type**: So you know how many lightbulbs you have. _#count_
  - Number of `air_quality` entities.
  - Number of `alarm_control_panel` entities.
  - Number of `binary_sensor` entities.
  - Number of `button` entities.

  - Number of `water_heater` entities.
  - Number of `weather` entities.
- **Number of areas**: In case you forgot how many rooms your house has. _#1_
- **Number of automations**: Because that is such a useful metric. _#robots_
- **Number of devices**: That are in the device registry. _#bling_
- **Number of persons**: How many people are you constantly tracking the location of? _#privacy_
- **Number of scenes**: Maybe you can ask your partner to make a scene... _#fight_
- **Number of scripts**: More than the average unemployed actor yet? _#hollywood_
- **Number of suns**: Answers how godlike you are. _#burn_
- **Number of zones**: How many comfort zones you have on a map. _#zoneing_
- **Number of integrations in use**: Consider using less integrations. _#lessismore_

# Services

There are quite a few useless and horrible services available for you to explore
and self-destruct your setup with. The developer service tools are great
to get you into such a situation.

# Repairs

Spook will float around your Home Assistant instance, and while it does, it
might be able to find things that need your attention. Spook will notify you
about these things using an Home Assistant repair issue. _#whoyougonnacall_

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your repairs.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/repairs.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/repairs/)

Currently Spook will detect the following issues:

## Obsolete integration YAML configuration

> Finds YAML configuration for an integrations that no longer support it.
> Unless you like having unneeded shizzle in your YAML, it can be removed
> safely. _#ghostbusters_

## Automations: Find use of non-existing areas, devices and entities

> Finds automations that use non-existing areas, devices or entities in, for
> example, their service calls. _#springcleaning_

_Intention to contribute back to Home Assistant Core once sure no false
postives remain, and it has been extended to catch more situations._

## Groups: Detect unknown group members

> Finds groups that contain references to unknown members (entities). _#aliens_

_Intention to contribute back to Home Assistant Core._

## Riemann sum integral: Detect missing source sensor

> Finds integrals that are missing a source sensor. _#missinglink_

_Intention to contribute back to Home Assistant Core._

## Scripts: Find use of non-existing areas, devices and entities

> Finds scripts that use non-existing areas, devices or entities in, for
> example, their service calls. _#void_

_Intention to contribute back to Home Assistant Core once sure no false
postives remain, and it has been extended to catch more situations._

# Frequently Asked Questions

In the first few days after putting Spook out, some of the same questions
kept popping up. So, here are some answers to those questions.

## Is this a serious thing?

Yes! It is just not a normal integration, like one that connects to a device or
service, or one that provides a helper of some sort. But it is a serious
integration, that is meant to be used in a serious way.

## Why is Spook called Spook?

I (Frenck) am Dutch. I grew up with "Casper het vriendelijke spookje", also
known as "Casper the friendly ghost". "Spook" is the Dutch for "ghost".

Casper is scary at first sight, but you could really love him in the end. Which
seems fitting for a custom integration, as custom integrations are more likely
to break, thus being a little scared of them is not a bad thing.

"Not your homie" is a refence to my the livestreams I used to do. I called my
viewers "My Home Assistant Homies", or just "Homies". It is thus referring
to you, the Home Assistant user, as my friend, my homie. However, "Spook" is
not your homie, it is a ghost, a spooky thing, he is suposed to make you think
a little about what you are doing before you use it.

Nice little fact, I did use "homey" at first (to maybe annoy the Homey users a
bit in SEO), but I decided not to be that _badword_ and to change it back to
just "homie".

Lastly, the little ghost logo & use of the emoji. This is great inspiration
from the Mushroom card project (I love it!). They use a simple mushroom emoji
and you see it everywhere in the Home Assistant community, thus decided to do
a similar thing.

## Does this integration break my Home Assistant instance?

Well, that is not the goal of course. But, it is a custom integration, so
there is a chance it might break your instance. This applies to any custom
integration, not just Spook.

I'm just sharing what I have, without any warranty. I've decided to be blunt
about it, and make it at least fun to read. I could have written a small
warning, that would have been boring.

## Does Spook do random things to my home?

No. It does not do random things. It is not a chaos testing thing and
it will not turn lights on/off randomly in the night. Unless it is a bug
or broken of course.

## Ok, so should I use Spook?

No! The license doesn't allow that (see below).

# Changelog & Releases

This repository does not keep a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on the direction the wind blows.

Releases use a [Semantic Versioning][semver], compatible version number of
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, as that is required for Home Assistant. In a nutshell,
the version will be incremented based on the following:

- `MAJOR`: If there is almost nothing changed.
- `MINOR`: I have no idea, possibily breaking.
- `PATCH`: I didn't care enough to change more numbers.
